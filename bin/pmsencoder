# we need to avoid users having to set a bunch of environment variables to run this
# (local::lib makes this bearable for command-line use, but it's fraught with
# agita when run by PMS itself, which may be run as a service e.g. without the
# niceties exported by local::lib).
# on non-Win, it must be installed in a local lib (i.e. via local::lib), so we can
# figure out the @INC paths to our dependencies from the PERL5LIB output of the moral
# (i.e. programmatic) equivalent of perl -I~/perl5 -Mlocal::lib
#
# Note: we only need @INC (via its PERL5LIB) from local::lib; we're not installing anything,
# so we don't need the MB/EUMM stuff (though the installer *does* use those)

# to this, and may otherwise wish to use this with Strawberry/Active...
